# Morse-Code-Translator-UI

I chose to do this, because  there's been times where some video games have morse code as a puzzle. And thought it would be a fun way to learn morse code.

Requirements:
    - Visual Studio Code
    - Python 3.10
    - Venv (virtual enviornment)
Instructions:
    - Download the files (can use clone Git)
    - On the terminal create venv by typing $ python -m venv .venv
    - Run the command to instal the requirements $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    - Run qmake.py if there were any changes to the ui since the gen file is already there
    - Run translator.py to launch
